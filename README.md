### Get started

environment: Python 3 in training model, Android Studio in app.

#### main dependencies

- tensorflow -`pip install tensorflow`
- Android Studio: follow [this](https://developer.android.google.cn/) and install it.

### How use it

1. train model. Enter 'handwriting_recognization' folder. Just run 'train.py' to train model. Actually, the trained model named 'gesture.pb' has been uploaded in 'handwriting_recognization/model' folder. 

   ```python
   python handwriting_recognization/train.py
   ```

2. put trained model into Android app. You can follow [Introduction to TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/) and [TensorFlow Lite Demo for Android](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.5/mobile/tflite/demo_android) to know about how to migrate model to Android app. You can follow [Android Studio OpenCV环境的简单搭建](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_18870023/article/details/58203990) to know about configuring OpenCV in Android application(Chinese). In this project, you just press 'run' button in Android Studio and install this app on your Android phone.

### File structure

- HandwritingRecognization: Android project. Open this project by Android Studio. Code path conforms to Android standard development specification.
- handwriting_recognization: Train model by [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
  - capslayer: capsule network package. This is a novel deep learning model proposed by Hinton. You can know more about it by [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829v1) and [Capsule Network](https://www.cnblogs.com/mengnan/p/9307454.html)(Chinese).
  - data: dataset. The original image file is placed in 'origin' folder. Image file in 'resized' folder can be generated by code. 'resized_image.h5' stores fully processed images.
  - model: store trained model.
  - capsule_network.py: top level api of capslayer.
  - data_utils: some tools of image data.
  - global_vals.py: global variable in this project.
  - load_pb_model.py: test the trained model.
  - train.py: main function. train the model.
